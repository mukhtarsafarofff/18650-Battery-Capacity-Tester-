Nowadays it is difficult to know the capacity retained in 18650 batteries and when we are buying , it is really difficult to distinguish between a real and fake battery .The whole schematic is divided into to followings sections:
1. Constant Current Load Circuit
2. Battery Voltage Measurement Circuit
3. User Interface Circuit
4. Buzzer Circuit
The battery voltage is measured by the Arduino analog input pin A0. Two capacitors C1 and C2 are used to filter out the noises coming from the constant current load circuit which can degrade the ADC conversion performance.
